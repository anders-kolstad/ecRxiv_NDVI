<!--# This is a template for how to document the indicator analyses. Make sure also to not change the order, or modify, the headers, unless you really need to. This is because it easier to read if all the indicators are presented using the same layout. If there is one header where you don't have anything to write, just leave the header as is, and dont write anything below it. If you are providing code, Be careful to annotate and comment on every step in the analysis.-->

# Indicator name

<!--# Replace 'indicator name' with your the actual indicator name -->

<br />

<!--# Load all you dependencies here -->

```{r setup}
#| include: false
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

<!--# Use the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology (GET) to describe which ecosystem the indicator belongs to. https://doi.org/10.2305/IUCN.CH.2020.13.en. If the indicator covers more than one category in the GET, choose the most prominent one here, and use the text to elaborate on the ecosystem affiliations. -->

```{r GET}
#| echo: false

Realm <- "Enter realm" # e.g. "Terrestrial"
Biome <- "Enter biome" #e.g. "Temperate-boreal forests and woodland"
EFG   <- "Enter EFG" # Ecosystem functional group, e.g. "Deciduous temperate forests"
```

<!--# Enter the ecosystem condition typology (ECT) class that your indicator best adhers too (10.3897/oneeco.6.e58218) -->

```{r ECT}
#| echo: false
ECT <- "Enter ECT" # e.g. "Structural state characteristic"
```

```{r, echo=F}
metaData <- data.frame(
  Realm,
  Biome,
  EFG, 
  "ECT class" = ECT)
knitr::kable(t(metaData))

```

<!--# Document you work below.  -->

## 1. Introduction

<!--# Describe the indicator in general terms. It is a good idea to include a bullet point list of the spesific steps in the workflow -->

## 2. About the underlying data

<!--# Describe the data you have used, it's origin, biases, avaiabilit ect.-->

### 2.1 Spatial and temporal resolution

<!--# Describe the temporal and spatial resolution of the data used-->

### 2.2 Original units

<!--# What are the original units for the most relevant  variables in the data-->

### 2.3 Additional comments about the dataset

<!--# Text here -->

## 3. Indicator properties

### 3.1. ECT

<!--# Describe the rationale for assigning the indicator to the ECT class -->

### 3.2. Ecosystem condition characteristic

<!--# Describe the ecosystem condition characteristic represneted in the indicator. See 10.3897/oneeco.6.e58218 for information on what these characteristics might be. -->

### 3.3. Other standards

<!--# Add text about other spesific standards, e.g. natinoal standards, and how the indicator relates to these -->

### 3.4. Collinearities with other indicators

<!--# Describe known collinearities with other metrices (indicators or variables) that could become problematic if they were also included in the same Ecosystem Condition Assessment as the indicator described here. -->

## 4. Reference condition and values

### 4. 1. Reference condition

<!--# Define the reference condition (or refer to where it is defined). Note the destinction between reference condition and reference values 10.3897/oneeco.5.e58216  -->

### 4. 2. Reference values

#### 4.2.1 Minimum and maximum values

<!--# Describe the reference values used to set the lower and upper limits on the normative indicator scale. Why was the current option chosen and how were the reference values quantified? If the reference values are calculated as part of the analyses further down, please repeat the main information here. -->

#### 4.2.2. Threshold value for defining *good ecological condition (if relevant)*

<!--# Describe the different reference values here and the justification for using these -->

#### 4.2.3. Spatial resolution and validity 

<!--# Describe the spatial resolution of the reference values. E.g. is it defined as a fixed value for all areas, or does it vary. Also, at what spatial scale is the reference values valid? For example, if the reference value has a regional resolution (varies between regions), it might mean that it is only valid and correct to use for scaling local variable values that are first aggregated to regional scale. However, sometimes the reference value is insensitive to this and can be used to scale variables at the local (e.g. plot) scale.  -->

## 5. Uncertainties

<!--# Describe the main uncertainties or sources of error in the indicator or the underlying data. -->

## 6. References

<!--# You can add references manually or use a citation manager and add intext citations as with crossreferencing and hyperlinks. See https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html -->

## 7. Datasets

<!--# Describe the unique datasets seperately under seperate headers (Dataset A, Dataset B, etc.-->

### 7.1 Dataset A

<!--# Describe the main dataset, typicaly the one containing the variable of (most) interest. Change the header from Dataset A to the name of the actuall dataset. -->

### 7.2. Dataset B

<!--# Describe additional datasets in a similar was as above. Deleteor add ned subheaders as needed. -->

## 8. Spatial units

<!--# Describe the spatial units that you rely on in your analyses. Highlight the spatial units (the resolution) that the indicator values should be interpretted at. Potential spatial delineation data should eb introduced under 7.1. Datasets. We recomend using the SEEA EA terminology opf Basic Spatial Units (BSU), Ecosystem Asses (EA) and Ecosystem Accounting Area (EAA). -->

## 9. Analyses

<!--# Use this header for documenting the analyses. Put code in seperate code chunks, and annotate the code in between using normal text (i.e. between the chunks, and try to avoid too many hashed out comments inside the code chunks). Add subheaders as needed. -->

## 10. Results

<!--# Repeat the final results here. Typically this is a map or table of indicator values.-->

## 11. Export file 

<!--# Display the code (don't execute it) or the workflow for exporting the indicator values to file. Ideally the indicator values are exported as a georeferenced shape or raster file with indicators values, reference values and errors. You can also chose to export the raw (un-normalised or unscaled variable) as a seperate product. You should not save large sptaial output data on GitHub. You can use eval=FALSE to avoid code from being executed (example below - delete if not relevant) -->

```{r export}
#| eval: false
```
